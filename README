o About this software...
   HMMER is an implementation of profile HMM methods for
   sensitive database searches using multiple sequence alignments as queries.

   Basically, you give HMMER a multiple sequence alignment as input;
   it builds a statistical model called a "hidden Markov model"
   which you can then use as a query into a sequence database
   to find (and/or align) additional homologues of the sequence family.
